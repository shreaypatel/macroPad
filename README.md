This repository contains the relevant documentation for my custom macropad project. I designed this macropad to be slim, portable and minimalist to match my use case needs. I will primarily use it for onshape CAD shortcut, 
but I am looking to explore setting up a different mode on it for KiCad shortcuts. The macropad connects to a computer via usb c. I began my design process with the wiring of the schematic. Here I opted for a 3x2 keyboard matrix 
to set up the switch connections. This takes up less input connections on the microcontroller while allowing me to customize 6 individual cherry mx switches. Next, I connected the diodes in between the switches to prevent keyboard
ghosting. Lastly, I set up a rotary rotary encoder switch for the zoom function on onshape CAD.
